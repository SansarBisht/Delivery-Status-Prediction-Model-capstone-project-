# Delivery-Status-Prediction-Model-capstone-project-
This project aims to predict the delivery status of orders in a supply chain using historical data on orders, customer categories, product attributes, and shipping details. By developing a machine learning model, we will forecast whether an order will be delivered successfully or face delays.
